This project demonstrates how memory works in real C projects using **stack, static, and heap memory**.

## Folder Structure
- **src/** – C programs for memory demonstration  
- **docs/** – Diagrams and explanations  
- **tests/** – Shell script for testing programs  

## Topics Covered
- Static memory (compile-time)
- Dynamic memory (runtime)
- Stack vs Heap
- Real project examples
- Correct usage of malloc/free

## How to Run
